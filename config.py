        "Use this calculator to estimate the financial benefits of installing a solar panel system. "
        "Enter your preferred system size, select your current energy tariff, and set an export rate "
        "to see detailed projections of costs, savings, and payback periods."

    'annual_overview': (
        "This comparison shows how much you could save annually by installing solar. "
        "It currently assumes that future energy costs will remain constant for your selected tariff."
    ),
    
    'monthly_breakdown': (
        "Monthly costs vary significantly throughout the year due to seasonal changes in both "
        "solar generation and energy consumption. Summer months typically show the highest savings "
        "due to increased solar output, while winter months may have minimal solar contribution."
    ),
    
    'solar_vs_consumption': (
        "This chart compares your monthly solar generation against your energy consumption. "
        "When solar generation exceeds consumption, you'll export excess energy to the grid. "
        "The gap between these lines shows your remaining grid dependency."
    ),
    
    'export_savings': (
        "Export revenue is earned when your solar system generates more electricity than you consume. "
        "Total monthly savings combine both the electricity you don't need to buy from the grid "
        "and the revenue from exporting excess energy. Note that export rates are typically lower than import rates."
    ),
    
    'cumulative_projection': (
        "This projection shows how your savings accumulate over time compared to the initial "
        "system cost. The payback period is when cumulative savings equal your initial investment. "
        "This assumes constant energy prices and system performance - actual results may vary."

        "• Array Size: Larger systems generate more electricity but cost more upfront\n"

        "• Export Rate: The rate you'll be paid for excess energy sent to the grid"
